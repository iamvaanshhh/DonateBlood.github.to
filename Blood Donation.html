            Blood donation is a voluntary procedure that can help save lives. There are several types of blood donation. Each type helps meet different medical needs
        </p>

            Whole blood donation

        <p>
            Whole blood donation is the most common type of blood donation. During this donation, you donate about a pint (about half a liter) of whole blood. The blood is then separated into its components â€” red cells, plasma and sometimes platelets
        </p>

        <h1>
            Apheresis
        </h1>
        <hr>
    <div class="Apheresis">
        <p>
            During apheresis, you are hooked up to a machine that collects and separates different parts of your blood. These blood components include red cells, plasma and platelets. The machine then returns the remaining parts of the blood back to you.
            



            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Platelet donation (plateletpheresis)</strong>collects only platelets. Platelets are the cells that help stop bleeding by clumping and forming plugs in blood vessels (clotting).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Donated platelets are commonly given to people with clotting problems or cancer and people who will have organ transplants or major surgeries
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Double red cell donation</strong>allows you to donate a concentrated amount of red blood cells. Red blood cells deliver oxygen to your organs and tissues.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Donated red blood cells are typically given to people with severe blood loss, such as after an injury or accident, and people with anemia (low hemoglobin).
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Plasma donation (plasmapheresis) </strong>collects the liquid portion of the blood (plasma). Plasma helps blood clot and contains antibodies that help fight off infections.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Plasma is commonly given to people in emergency and trauma situations to help stop bleeding.

                Blood donation is safe. New, sterile disposable equipment is used for each donor, so there's no risk of getting a bloodborne infection by donating blood.
                <br>
                <br>
                Most healthy adults can donate a pint (about half a liter) safely, without health risks. Within a few days of a blood donation, your body replaces the lost fluids. And after two weeks, your body replaces the lost red blood cells.

            Before your blood donation:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Get plenty of sleep the night before you plan to donate.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Eat a healthy meal before your donation. Avoid fatty foods, such as a hamburger, fries or ice cream.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Drink plenty of water before the donation.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Check to see if any medications you are taking or recently took would prevent you from donating. For example, if you are a platelet donor, you must not take aspirin for two days prior to donating. Talk to a member of your health care team before you stop taking any medications in order to donate blood.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Wear a shirt with sleeves that can be rolled up.
                </li>
